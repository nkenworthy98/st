#+TITLE: st - simple terminal

* st
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


* Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


* Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

#+begin_src shell
make clean install
#+end_src

* Running st
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

#+begin_src shell
tic -sx st.info
#+end_src

See the man page for additional details.
